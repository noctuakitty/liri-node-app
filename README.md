# liri-node-app
LIRI is like iPhone's SIRI. However, while SIRI is a Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface, LIRI is a _Language_ Interpretation and Recognition Interface. 

LIRI will be a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data.

My challenges were abundunt during this project. 
From not understanding a switch at first to inquire. 

Screenshots of app working in the screenshot folder.

This app uses axios, dotenv, file-system, inquirer, moment, the node spotify api, and javascript. 

To run this app, open the terminal in vscode and simply type "node liri.js" and you will be given a menu. Use the arrow keys to navigate and "enter" to choose. 

Once you choose you will be prompted with a question, depending on your choice the question will vary. Choose between searching for a song on spotify, a band for a concert with bandsintown, or a movie with omdb. Once you've hit enter you can input your search. Hit enter again and tada you've used liri. Liri will ask if you want to do another search, "Y" for yes and "N" for no. If you hit the "y" button and "enter" you will be taken back to the main menu.
